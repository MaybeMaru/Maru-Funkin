## Stuff you will need to compile

First, you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel. Make sure you download the LATEST versions.

1. [Install Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/)

Other installations you'd need are the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Currently, these are all of the things you need to install:

1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.
3. Run these commands in the CMD
